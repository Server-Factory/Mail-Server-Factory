## Stability Issues

### CRITICAL Issues

#### 1. SSH Connection Pooling - Potential Resource Leak
**Location**: `Core/Framework/src/main/kotlin/net/milosvasic/factory/remote/ssh/SSH.kt`

**Issue**: SSH connections are pooled but may not be properly closed in all error scenarios.

**Impact**:
- File descriptor exhaustion on long-running deployments
- Memory leaks from unclosed connections
- Potential deadlock if connection pool exhausted

**Evidence**: Connection objects stored in map without guaranteed cleanup
```kotlin
private val connections = mutableMapOf<String, SSH>()
```

**Recommendation**:
- Implement connection lifecycle management
- Add timeout-based connection recycling
- Implement connection health checks
- Use try-with-resources pattern

**Severity**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: Medium (long-running deployments)

---

#### 2. Reboot Step - No Confirmation of System Coming Back
**Location**: Installation steps with `"type": "reboot"`

**Issue**: Reboot step has timeout (480 seconds) but no verification that system actually came back online.

**Impact**:
- Deployment may continue even if remote system failed to reboot
- Subsequent steps will fail with cryptic SSH errors
- No rollback mechanism

**Evidence**: From `Centos/Docker.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "reboot",
  "value": "480"
}
```

**Recommendation**:
- Implement post-reboot health check
- Verify SSH connectivity after reboot
- Verify critical services started (systemd, network)
- Add configurable retry logic

**Severity**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: High (hardware issues, kernel panics)

---

#### 3. Docker Installation - No Verification of Docker Daemon
**Location**: All Docker installation recipes

**Issue**: Installation runs `docker run --rm hello-world` but doesn't verify Docker daemon is actually running and healthy.

**Impact**:
- Deployment may succeed but Docker daemon not functional
- Subsequent container deployments will fail
- No clear error message about root cause

**Evidence**: From `Ubuntu/Docker.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "value": "docker run --rm hello-world"
}
```

**Recommendation**:
- Add `systemctl is-active docker` check
- Add `docker info` health check
- Verify Docker can pull images
- Check Docker storage driver is configured correctly

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Likelihood**: Medium (storage issues, SELinux conflicts)

---

### MEDIUM Issues

#### 4. No Rollback Mechanism
**Issue**: If deployment fails midway, no automated rollback to clean state.

**Impact**:
- Partially configured servers
- Manual cleanup required
- Difficult to retry deployment

**Recommendation**:
- Implement checkpointing
- Create snapshots before major changes
- Add rollback commands for each step
- Implement idempotent operations

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Likelihood**: High (network failures, repository issues)

---

#### 5. Package Installation - No Dependency Resolution Check
**Location**: All installation recipes using `"type": "packages"`

**Issue**: Package manager may fail due to unresolved dependencies or repository issues.

**Impact**:
- Installation stops with unclear error
- No retry mechanism for transient failures
- No alternative repository fallback

**Evidence**: From `AlmaLinux/Docker.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "packages",
  "value": "iptables, iptables-services, docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io, telnet"
}
```

**Recommendation**:
- Pre-check repository availability
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add alternative repository sources
- Validate package versions available

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Likelihood**: High (network issues, repository downtime)

---

#### 6. Hardcoded Timeouts
**Location**: Various scripts and installation steps

**Issue**: Timeouts are hardcoded (480 seconds for reboot, etc.) and not configurable.

**Impact**:
- May be too short for slow systems
- May be too long for fast systems
- No adaptation to system performance

**Recommendation**:
- Make timeouts configurable via variables
- Implement adaptive timeouts based on system response
- Add progress indicators instead of blind waiting

**Severity**: LOW
**Likelihood**: Medium (slow VMs, network latency)

---

## Safety Issues

### CRITICAL Issues

#### 7. SELinux Disabled Without Warning
**Location**: All RHEL-based recipes

**Issue**: SELinux is automatically disabled without user confirmation or documentation of security implications.

**Impact**:
- Reduced system security
- Compliance violations (some regulations require SELinux)
- No option to keep SELinux enabled

**Evidence**: From `Centos/Docker.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "value": "sh {{SERVER.UTILS_HOME}}/setenforce.sh"
}
```

**Recommendation**:
- Document security implications in README
- Make SELinux disabling optional
- Provide alternative: Configure Docker to work with SELinux
- Add warning message during deployment

**Severity**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: N/A (always happens)

---

#### 8. Docker Login Credentials in Plain Text
**Location**: Configuration files and command execution

**Issue**: Docker credentials passed as plain text in configuration files and command line.

**Impact**:
- Credentials visible in process list (`ps aux`)
- Credentials logged in system logs
- Credentials in configuration files on disk

**Evidence**: From `Ubuntu/Docker.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "value": "docker login -u '{{DOCKER.LOGIN.ACCOUNT}}' -p '{{DOCKER.LOGIN.PASSWORD}}'"
}
```

**Recommendation**:
- Use Docker credential helpers
- Encrypt credentials in configuration
- Use environment variables instead of command-line args
- Implement secret management (HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

**Severity**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: N/A (always happens)

---

#### 9. No Input Validation on Variables
**Location**: Variable substitution system

**Issue**: Variables are substituted without validation, allowing potential command injection.

**Impact**:
- Command injection vulnerability
- SQL injection in database operations
- Path traversal attacks

**Evidence**: Variables like `{{PROXY.HOST}}` are directly substituted into shell commands without sanitization.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement input validation for all variables
- Whitelist allowed characters
- Escape special characters
- Use parameterized commands where possible

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Likelihood**: Low (requires malicious configuration file)

---

### MEDIUM Issues

#### 10. iptables Disabled for mDNS - Potential Security Hole
**Location**: `Core/Utils/disable_iptables_for_avahi_mdns.sh`

**Issue**: Script can completely disable iptables, not just open mDNS port.

**Impact**:
- All firewall rules removed
- Server exposed to network attacks
- No protection for mail services

**Evidence**: From script:
```bash
systemctl stop iptables
systemctl disable iptables
```

**Recommendation**:
- Only open specific mDNS port (5353 UDP)
- Keep iptables enabled
- Add proper firewall rules for mail services
- Document firewall configuration in manual

**Severity**: HIGH
**Likelihood**: Medium (if mDNS configuration requested)

---

- Malicious software installation
- Compromised system

**Evidence**: From various recipes:
```json
{
  "type": "command",
  "value": "curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/{{DOCKER.COMPOSE_VERSION}}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o {{DOCKER.COMPOSE_PATH}}/docker-compose"
}
```

**Recommendation**:
- Always verify SSL certificates
- Download and verify checksums (SHA256)
- Use GPG signature verification
- Implement file integrity checks

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Likelihood**: Low (requires MITM attack)

---

#### 12. Root Access Required - No Privilege Separation
**Location**: All deployment operations

**Issue**: All operations run as root with no privilege separation.

**Impact**:
- Increased attack surface
- No audit trail of which user made changes
- Violates principle of least privilege

**Recommendation**:
- Implement sudo-based privilege escalation
- Use service accounts for specific operations
- Implement proper audit logging
- Document which operations require root

**Severity**: MEDIUM
**Likelihood**: N/A (design decision)

---

## Performance Issues
