   - Supported Distributions Guide
   - Testing Matrix Tutorial

3. **Professional Translation** (if budget available)
   - Hire professional translators for 26 languages
   - Focus on core documentation first
   - Use translation management system (TMS)

### Medium Priority

4. **Create Professional Diagrams**
   - Use draw.io, Lucidchart, or PlantUML
   - Export as SVG for web, PNG for documentation
   - Create interactive diagrams if possible

5. **Complete API Documentation**
   - Generate from code comments
   - Use Javadoc/KDoc for Kotlin code
   - Create OpenAPI spec for any REST APIs

### Lower Priority

6. **Video Tutorials** (if resources available)
   - Screen recordings with narration
   - Subtitle in multiple languages
   - Host on YouTube with playlists

7. **Interactive Documentation**
   - Use Docusaurus, GitBook, or MkDocs
