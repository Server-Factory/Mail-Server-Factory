### Reading Path for Different Needs

**For Quick Understanding (30 minutes):**
1. Read ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md completely
2. Skim QUICK_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md diagrams
3. Reference specific code as needed

**For Implementation (2-3 hours):**
1. Read ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md
2. Read QUICK_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md
3. Reference COMPREHENSIVE_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md Section corresponding to your component
4. Read actual source files

**For Deep Understanding (4-6 hours):**
1. Read ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md
2. Read COMPREHENSIVE_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md completely
3. Read QUICK_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md
4. Study actual source code with file locations as guide
5. Trace execution flows end-to-end

**For Specific Component (varies):**
1. Use QUICK_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md file locations table
2. Read corresponding section in COMPREHENSIVE_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md
3. Read actual source file
4. Cross-reference with related components

## Key Concepts Quick Reference

### Two-Tier OS Detection
- **Host OS**: Where Java application runs (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- **Remote OS**: Target server being configured (CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- Both use different detection mechanisms
- Both influence behavior throughout deployment

### Installation Architecture
- **Recipe-based**: JSON definitions specify installation steps
- **OS-specific**: Each recipe has CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu variants
- **Step types**: packages, commands, groups, conditions, reboots, databases, deployments
- **Dynamic selection**: Detected OS determines which recipe variant to use

### Configuration Resolution
- **Hierarchical includes**: Example config includes Common, which includes multiple sub-configs
- **Definition loading**: Software definitions loaded based on detected OS
- **Variable substitution**: `{{CONTEXT.KEY}}` replaced with values
- **Fallback chains**: If exact platform not found, falls back to more general platforms

### Remote Execution
- **SSH connection pooling**: Connections cached by remote address
- **Platform detection**: Determined via SSH commands and output parsing
- **Package manager abstraction**: Yum for RPM, Apt for Debian, etc.
- **OS-specific commands**: Generated based on detected platform

### Deployment Orchestration
- **Sequential flows**: InitializationFlow → InstallationFlow → DockerFlow → DatabaseFlow → MailFlow
- **Flow-based execution**: Each flow runs its contained steps
- **Condition handling**: Some steps conditionally skip based on checks
- **Error handling**: Failures stop execution, success callbacks trigger next flow

## Known Issues Found

1. **Host OS Detection Bug** (OperatingSystem.kt lines 37, 40)
   - All three platform detection methods check for "mac"
   - Should check "linux" and "win" as well

2. **Remote OS Architecture**
   - Initialized as UNKNOWN, properly populated during parseAndSetSystemInfo()

3. **Variable Substitution Limitations**
   - Limited support for nested references
   - Currently `${CONTEXT.KEY}` only
